## Unity GUI kit

This project contains some parts of mobile app GUI for Unity
the components that are included:
- Drawers
- Scroll Pane (quick scroll as an opposite to the slow built-in one)
- Calendar with an ability to pick a range of dates
- Progress bars (animated), including circular ones
- Toggles (switches)

Anyone who needs it may use or modify these components as he wants. 
Unfortunately I don't have time to support this project, so I'm putting it down as is

## Example

The example scene is included
